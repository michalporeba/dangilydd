# Dangilydd

The name comes from Welsh *'da'n gilydd* meaning *together*.

## What is it all about? 

**Volunteering!** Especially in environments where training and governance are essential - like **first aid** volunteering. But also about using **open-source** as a form of **volunteering** in (many) **local communities**. 

I think it is important.

## Context

The early 2020s changed a lot. For one reason or another, we don't volunteer in our communities as much as we used to. That's a phenomenon experienced by several organisations I know. 

There are many reasons. I have yet to find a definitive academic paper on the subject, but volunteering organisations are looking into it. You can read more about it on [Track It Forward](https://www.trackitforward.com/content/why-adult-volunteers-quit-and-what-you-can-do-prevent-them-quitting)) or [CharityChoice](https://www.charitychoice.co.uk/the-fundraiser/how-volunteering-has-changed-in-a-post-pandemic-world).

My hypothesis is that this is driven by the change in how we experience the world. We expect a different, often digital, mobile-first experience. We want to instantly see what we have achieved and our impact. Without it, we lose interest and motivation. 

No wonder [gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) is an increasingly popular technique in many areas. We can bring it to first aid volunteering and help with volunteering experience, recruitment, retention, but also satisfaction and governance. 

By doing it as an open-source project, we make digital first aid volunteering possible with the benefits accessible to local communities worldwide. 

## Problem domain

Sometime, to run an event one may need a group of suitably qualified individuals. Their training, qualifications and suitability have to managed.
