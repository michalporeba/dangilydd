# Dangilydd

The name comes from Welsh *'da'n gilydd* meaning *together*.

## What is it all about? 

**Volunteering!** Especially in environments where training and governance are essential - like **first aid** volunteering. But also about using **open-source** as a form of **volunteering** in (many) **local communities**. 

I think it is important.

## The Context

The early 2020s changed a lot. For one reason or another, we don't volunteer in our communities as much as we used to. That's a phenomenon experienced by several organisations I know. 

There are many reasons. I have yet to find a definitive academic paper on the subject, but volunteering organisations are looking into it. You can read more about it on [Track It Forward](https://www.trackitforward.com/content/why-adult-volunteers-quit-and-what-you-can-do-prevent-them-quitting) or [CharityChoice](https://www.charitychoice.co.uk/the-fundraiser/how-volunteering-has-changed-in-a-post-pandemic-world).

My hypothesis is that this is driven by the change in how we experience the world. We expect a different, often digital, mobile-first experience. We want to instantly see what we have achieved and our impact. Without it, we lose interest and motivation. 

No wonder [gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) is an increasingly popular technique in many areas. We can bring it to first aid volunteering and help with volunteering experience, recruitment, retention, but also satisfaction and governance. 

By doing it as an open-source project, we make digital first aid volunteering possible with the benefits accessible to local communities worldwide. 

## The Idea

Use the modern user-centric design approach to build a free, mobile-first volunteering experience app. Something that will help engage with a new generation of first-aid volunteers. Something to help them sign up, find the necessary training, measure their progress and show their impact on their communities. 

To do it, we will need to assemble a cross-functional team of people interested in software, and digital services, but also in saving lives in their communities. You can join the team too!

What will be the end result? It is difficult to say right now. We will need to find out what is most valuable. After all, it is just an idea, a set of working hypotheses backed by a few assumptions. 

What is certain is that the solution will have to be secure. It will deal with the personal information of volunteers. It will need to provide reliable information to deal with medical governance and show that people involved in volunteering had adequate training to perform specific roles. 

The user's journeys that may be in scope can include: 
* A new volunteer learning about volunteering, deciding to sign up to become a member of an organisation. 
* Progressing through necessary training unlocks additional things the volunteer can help with, including different event types they can attend.
* Ability to record and prove the necessary proficiency and currency with skills, including recording experience.

## The Product Assumptions
* Digital-first approach will help us engage with future generations.
* User-centric design with accessibility in mind will help us engage with a wider, more diverse group of potential volunteers.
* Gamification will provide the needed level of interactivity to the experience. Instant feedback, self-service ability to discover information and next steps. 
* Working in the open, using open standards, open source, open data will allow for self-hosting of the solution by any organisation, making the outcome available anywhere in the world. 

## The Initial Constraints

Working in the open - because it is a volunteering project for volunteers. 
We will work in small and verifiable steps. TDD, CD and automation will be important.
Stack: flutter - because a single code base can give us multiple platforms. Backend? Don't know yet.
It has to be easy to deploy so anybody can run it.
It has to work with intermittent internet connectivity.
Data. We want to be ethical. Hold only what's needed, and if possible in something like Personal Online Solid Pods. 

## The small print
Most of the above may change as we learn about the problem.
